## Themes
If you want to create a theme for Latchkey, I'll have a more detailed explanation when I submit to bigboss,
but for now look under /Library/Application Support/Latchkey/Themes, and use the existing themes as a guide.
Or send me a message with a nice gif, and I'll do my best to add it.

## Installation
